    <h3>9.1 Shadows and Fading menus</h3>
</a><p><a name="Shadows"></a></p>
<p>If you thought that drop shadows, fading menus and true transparency were only possible in heavyweight desktop environments, here is a surprise. All of this is possible in Openbox (provided your hardware supports it – check <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75527">this thread</a> first) when you use <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/xcompmgr">xcompmgr</a>. Here is how you do it:
</p>
<p>Install xcompmgr through Synaptic or apt:</p>
<p></p><pre>	sudo aptitude install xcompmgr</pre>
<p></p>
<p>Enable compositing in your Xorg file. Open a terminal and open the Xorg file:</p>
<p></p><pre>	sudo your_text_editor /etc/X11/<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">xorg.conf</span></pre>
<p></p>
<p>and add the following to the end of the file:</p>
<pre>	Section "Extensions"
		Option "Composite" "Enable"
	EndSection</pre>
<p>Save and close the file. You’ll now have to restart X (the graphical environment). Make sure you have everything saved that is still open, and press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. You will be back at your login screen. Once you are back in Openbox, you can start using xcompmgr. You have plenty of options to experiment with. Have a look at <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=75527">jdong’s thread</a> about xcompmgr on the Ubuntuforums; you’ll find it very useful in finding the right xcompmgr settings for you (drop shadows, acceleration, fading menus, etc.).I prefer the following settings, which only displays drop shadows:</p>
